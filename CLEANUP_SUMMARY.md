# Project Cleanup Summary

## Files Deleted (Unnecessary for deployment):
- `build/` - Build artifacts directory (temporary files from PyInstaller)
- `run_secure_gui.bat` - Development batch file (not needed for deployment)
- `dist/SecureVLANSwitcher.zip` - Packaged zip file (the folder version is sufficient)

## Files Retained (Required for building and deployment):

### Core Application Files:
- `secure_vlan_gui.py` - Main GUI application
- `secure_vlan_switcher.py` - VLAN switching service logic
- `windows_service.py` - Windows service wrapper
- `vlan_switcher_service.py` - Service compatibility layer

### Build and Deployment:
- `build_secure.bat` - Build script for creating executables
- `SecureVLANSwitcher.spec` - PyInstaller specification file
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `dist/SecureVLANSwitcher/` - Built executables ready for deployment

### Documentation:

- `SECURITY_FEATURES.md` - Security feature documentation

### Version Control:
- `.git/` - Git repository
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

## Deployment Ready:
The `dist/SecureVLANSwitcher/` directory contains the built executables that can be deployed to target computers without requiring Python installation.

## Project Size Reduction:
- Removed build artifacts and temporary files
- Kept only essential files for building and deployment
- Project is now clean and ready for final deployment
